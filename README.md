# weighted-initialization


Training your neural network requires specifying an initial value of the weights. A well chosen initialization method will help learning.  

But how do you choose the initialization for a new neural network? In this notebook, you will see how different initializations lead to different results. 

A well chosen initialization can:
- Speed up the convergence of gradient descent
- Increase the odds of gradient descent converging to a lower training (and generalization) error 

To get started, run the following cell to load the packages and the planar dataset you will try to classify.
